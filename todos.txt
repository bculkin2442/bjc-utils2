@TODO 10/08/17 Ben Culkin :ModuleSplitting
	Split BJC-Utils into multiple maven modules. That'll cut down on
	compilation times and also the amount of dependencies pulled in for
	certain things.

@TODO 10/11/17 Ben Culkin :Documentation
	Write a doclet for producing groff output so javadocs can be read as
	manpages.
